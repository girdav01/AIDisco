title: DNS Query to AI Content Writing and Productivity Tool
id: aidisco-net-012
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to AI-powered content writing, editing, and productivity tools.
  These services receive document content, emails, and text that may contain sensitive
  business information. Some of these tools (e.g., Notion AI, Grammarly) are embedded
  in productivity platforms making AI usage harder to distinguish from normal usage.
  Others (Jasper, Copy.ai) are dedicated AI content generators.
