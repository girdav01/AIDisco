title: DNS Query to Cloud Vector Database - Potential RAG Pipeline
id: aidisco-net-006
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to cloud-hosted vector database services. These are
  commonly used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines where
  organizational documents are embedded and stored externally. This represents
  a significant data exposure risk as document embeddings can potentially be
  reversed to reconstruct original content, and the services store semantic
  representations of potentially sensitive internal data.
