title: DNS Query Indicating AI Model Download Activity
id: aidisco-net-004
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to model registries and hosting platforms that indicate
  someone is downloading AI/ML models to run locally. While local models don't
  exfiltrate data during inference, the presence of unauthorized local AI
  infrastructure indicates shadow AI activity and may violate acceptable use
  policies. Large model downloads also consume significant bandwidth.
