title: DNS Query to AI Voice and Transcription Service
id: aidisco-net-011
status: experimental
description: |
  Detects DNS queries to AI-powered voice synthesis, speech-to-text, and meeting
  transcription services. These services are HIGH risk because they receive audio
  content that often includes confidential meeting discussions, internal strategy
  conversations, and sensitive business communications. Unauthorized use of
  transcription services on internal meetings is a significant data exposure vector.
